<h1 id="Anchor_164693456_h1_1">Provided Features</h1>
<p>NX currently provides two types of e-commerce features: downloadable content and subscription service items.</p>
<p>The content of each of these items are as follows.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Downloadable Content</td>
      <td>
        <p>Downloadable content refers to a method of selling content in which content is purchased outright and the content can be used indefinitely after it is bought. The user downloads the actual data for use at the same time that the license is acquired.</p>
        <p>Because this content is purchased outright from Nintendo eShop, the user does not need to be connected to the network to use the content.</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Additional character for a battle game</li>
          <li>Additional dungeon for an RPG</li>

        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Subscription Service Items</td>
      <td>
        <p>A subscription service item is a selling format that grants the purchaser the right to use a service (or other content) for a particular term. For example, you would use a service item to sell a user a license for a month of online gameplay.</p>
        <p>Unlike downloadable content, no data needs to be downloaded to the system after the license has been purchased for service items.</p>
        <p>Network connection to an independent server is used to check the license information and provide services based on that license. For this reason, to provide items you must prepare an independent server for each application. In addition, a network connection is required.</p>

    <p xmlns="">There currently is no feature that follows the conventional style for selling consumable items or any alternative features that would allow you to sell items like jewels that you can exchange for items inside the application. The timing for this release is TBD.</p>
    <p xmlns="">Contact Nintendo if your game design calls for features like selling consumable items.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_164693456_h1_2">Sales Methods</h1>
<p>Both downloadable content and subscription service items can be purchased from either the shop started from the HOME Menu or the EC applet called from within the application.</p>
<p>Purchase through the EC applet is provided only by having the process from listing the items through purchasing occur within the EC applet. Currently there is no feature available that allows you to obtain product information from the eShop server from within an application, display an item list, and purchase selected items. The time for this feature being available is TBD.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_164693456_h1_3">Purchase Method</h1>
<p>Downloadable content and service items can be purchased using an account balance or a credit card registered in Nintendo eShop, or by using item vouchers.</p>

      <th>Purchase Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Use Money in Account Balance</td>
      <td>
        <p>The account balance is the money the user has in their Nintendo Account. This balance is debited when an item is purchased.</p>
        <p>Users can add to their balances using either a credit card or a Nintendo Prepaid Card.</p>
        <p>For instance, purchasing a $10 Nintendo Prepaid Card and entering the card number into Nintendo eShop increases the balance by $10.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pay Directly With Credit Card</td>
      <td>
        <p>In this method, transactions are settled using the credit card registered in the Nintendo eShop.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Use Item Vouchers</td>
      <td>
        <p>Item vouchers have specific alphanumeric codes (item voucher codes) that can be entered to redeem the corresponding downloadable content.</p>
        <p>Contact Nintendo if you are considering a design that uses item vouchers.</p>
        <p>As now planned, this exchanging of vouchers for downloadable content will be possible only via the Nintendo eShop system application. No time frame has been set for when the EC applet will incorporate this functionality.</p>
        <p>There is no support for subscription service item vouchers. The timing for this release is TBD.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_164693456_h1_4">Promotional Code</h1>

<p>This feature can be used to distribute codes for using proprietary services.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_164693456_h1_5">Season Pass</h1>
<p>The season pass is a way for users to pre-purchase downloadable content that will become available at some later date.</p>
<p>There are restrictions on implementing season passes, so contact Nintendo if your game design calls for this feature.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_164693456_h1_6">Owner Discount</h1>
<p>An owner discount refers to a system that allows a user who has purchased and owns a certain item to purchase other items at a certain discounted price.</p>
