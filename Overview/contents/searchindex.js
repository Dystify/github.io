"\t\t\n4.1 The NX and Accounts\nWith the structure of the NX, a user registers to an NX system and then the registered user becomes linked to a Nintendo Account.\n Figure 4-1 Structure of Accounts on the NX\nIn this figure, (1) depicts the people who are using the NX system in the real world, (2) depicts the users registered to the system, and (3) depicts the Nintendo Accounts.\nSave data and other resources on the NX system are managed at the user level for users registered to the system. Users can register and use the system even if they are not connected to the network. A Nintendo Account is required in order to use network features on the NX. As many as eight different people can register as users on each NX system, and each user can be linked to a Nintendo Account.\nAccounts Place No Restrictions on Game Design\nNX accounts are purposely structured to place no restrictions on the game design.\nAn account does not need to be selected when the NX system is started, so you can design your application to make the selection at any time. You can ask the player to select an account in the regular way when the application starts, or you can support any of the following mechanisms to suit the game design.\n \tFor a fighting game, you can let users play in practice mode without selecting an account, and wait until they enter into the real fight mode, where scores are recorded, to select an account. \tFor titles that feature a collection of minigames, you can switch accounts for each try of each game. In this way, high scores are are recorded for each account. \tFor applications like simple party games where there is no need to store save data, you do not need to support accounts at all.\nThe NX system supports the simultaneous selection of multiple accounts. This means that scores can be recorded separately for each user when a number of people are playing together at the same time, like a sports game in doubles mode.\nThere are system features in the form of an applet which facilitates the implementation of processes in the application to switch accounts and register new users.

For more information about the friend list, see 5.2.1 My Page.\nScope of Usage\nNX friends are friends only within the scope of the NX platform and in principle only can be used in NX applications. They are not friends who are shared with non-NX applications that use Nintendo Accounts.\nIf you want, you can choose not to use the NX Friends feature, and instead make and use an application-specific friendship mechanism.\nBecoming Friends\nThe following methods for becoming friends are planned. The details are under evaluation.\n \tFriend request using a friend code\nMake the friend request using the code issued to each user. \tFriend request from Player History\nMake the friend request from the Player History in the application. \tFriend request from inside the application\nSend a friend request from inside the application (providing that the application supports calls to the system feature for making friend requests). \tSchedule friend request using local communication\nUse local communication and schedule friend requests to be sent to the users of nearby NX systems. Friendships cannot be established this way when NX systems are offline. The friendships are officially established the next time the NX systems connect to the Internet.\nThere are also plans to provide a feature to recommend users as candidate friends when they play on the NX if those users are already your friends in non-NX applications.\nFriend Presence\nFriend Presence is a feature that uses the Internet to convey information in real time about the online status of friends and the applications they are playing. Among possibilities, we see this being used in the application to check whether friends are in the joinable state, and to use the Friend List system feature screen to show what applications friends are playing.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]

"\t\t\n2 Features\nNX Characteristics\nThe NX is a console gaming device you can take outside. It combines the power of a console that offers solid and substantive gameplay with the flexibility of a handheld system that allows you to enjoy games wherever you can take them.\nNX combines the advanced performance of a console with a size and weight that makes it easy to take anywhere, similar to a handheld system. With its high resolution, large format LCD screen, NX offers a rich gaming experience, even when outside. NX also offers the same number of buttons as previous platforms. Even though it has a large LCD screen, the handheld system is light enough (at an estimated 402.5 g) and thin enough (at an estimated 13.94 mm) to be taken anywhere. When the NX is being used as a console, output to the TV is made via the NX dock that comes bundled with the system. Switching between TV mode and handheld mode is as simple as attaching and detaching the system to and from the dock. The same game can be played anywhere.\nThe NX comes with controllers called JOY-CON. There are independent left and right controllers. Holding the JOY-CON controllers in different ways and making different uses of the built-in sensors and features opens up a variety of new ways of gameplay.\n Figure 2-1 The JOY-CON Controllers and the NX console.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]
,["Pages/Page_162946811.html","2.1 JOY-CON Play Styles",
"\t\t\n2.1 JOY-CON Play Styles\nJOY-CON\n Figure 2-2 The JOY-CON\nThe JOY-CON is a pair of independent left and right wireless controllers. As shown in Figure 2-3 Ways to Hold the JOY-CON, there are several different ways to hold the JOY-CON, and this provides for a variety of possible styles of play.\nBoth the left and right JOY-CON controllers include an accelerometer and gyro sensor, allowing physical gameplay through hand and arm motions when held vertically. You can also enter different inputs with the left and right controllers when holding both controllers. Since the two controllers have the same combined number buttons as the Wii U GamePad, the pair can be held and used like a full-fledged multi-button controller for rich, solo gameplay. For this, the JOY-CON left and right controllers can be combined and used as a single controller by attaching them to the classic-grip accessory. The left and right controllers also can be held horizontally for gameplay, in which case each has a button configuration similar to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System controller. Finally, the JOY-CON controllers can be attached to the left and right sides of the main body and the NX played like a handheld game system.\nHowever, when the JOY-CON controllers are connected to the console, they communicate through a wired connection instead of wirelessly.\n Figure 2-3 Ways to Hold the JOY-CON\nDifferently from the devices of any past Nintendo platforms, the JOY-CON incorporates IR sensors to detect hands and other shapes, and linear resonant actuators to generate a range of vibrations. For more information about the other components built into the JOY-CON, see 3.2 JOY-CON Hardware Configuration.\nIR Sensor\nThe IR sensor comprises an infrared LED and an infrared camera. This component is built only into the right JOY-CON controller.\nObjects illuminated with the IR LED are captured with the IR camera to get an IR image. The hardware processes these IR images to recognize the movement and shape of objects. Because it uses infrared, this feature functions in dark locations as well. This enables the following features.\n \tRecognition of quick hand movements and hand shapes\tRecognizes the rotation, shaking, pitch, and position of hands, in addition to the shape, number, and outline of fingers.\n \tOptical attachments\tAttachments made only of plastic with no electric parts can be created if materials such as recursive retroreflectors are used.\nFor more information, see IR Sensor Guide.\nVibration Feature Using the Linear Resonant Actuator\nThe linear resonant actuator is fundamentally different from the eccentric rotating mass installed in the Wii U GamePad and other devices. This component is built into both the left and right JOY-CON controllers.\nThe response is more sensitive than past vibration features and the vibration intensity and frequency can be changed to enable richer expression. Besides simply making the vibration stronger or weaker, it can represent the real qualities of objects, such as the rolling of a light ball or the flow of water. This allows us to use the vibration feature in combination with the images and sounds in scenes that would not have used the vibration feature in the past.\nTo use the vibration feature in an application, you can create the vibration for each scene, as was done in the past, or you can create vibration data in advance and play that data. Vibration data can be created using a tool included in the development environment which can, for example, convert sound data to vibration.\nTaking full advantage of the richly expressive vibration of the linear resonant actuator will let applications offer more immersive experiences than ever before.\nFor more information, see the Linear Resonant Actuator Features Guide.\nPlay Styles\nThe NX can change play style depending on whether the system is sitting in the NX dock and whether the JOY-CON controllers are attached or detached. In this regard, the NX is a \"console to go.\"\nBelow is an overview of each of the gameplay styles. For details and descriptions of each gameplay style and the compatibility of each gameplay style within applications, refer to the Play Style Guide.\nTV Mode\n Figure 2-4 TV Mode\nSet in the NX dock, the NX can be played like a regular game console, using the TV as the display screen while using the JOY-CON to play the game.\nTabletop Mode\n Figure 2-5 Tabletop Mode\nIf you remove the NX from the dock when the system is using TV mode, the images that were being shown on the TV will now be shown on the NX screen. The NX system comes with a stand, and you can set the NX in this stand on a desktop and use it as your screen while playing the game with the JOY-CON. Thanks to the NX, the experience of a game console, where groups of people play with controllers while watching the game on the same, single screen, is untethered from the TV and made portable.\nWhen the NX is removed from the dock and moved around, it behaves differently in some ways. For more information, see Differences in Behavior When Removed From the NX Dock.\nHandheld Mode\n Figure 2-6 Handheld Mode\nBy attaching the JOY-CON controllers to the console, the NX can be played like a handheld game system. At this time, the JOY-CON controllers and the NX are connected through a wired connection.\nIf a user carries the NX around in handheld mode, that user is carrying around both JOY-CON controllers, so at any time the one system can be played by two people together in tabletop mode.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]

The user downloads the actual data for use at the same time that the license is acquired.\n Because this content is purchased outright from Nintendo eShop, the user does not need to be connected to the network to use the content.\n \t \tAdditional character for a battle game \tAdditional dungeon for an RPG \tAdditional course for a racing game\n \t \tNintendo eShop started from the HOME Menu \tEC applet called from within the application\n \tSubscription Service Items \t A subscription service item is a selling format that grants the purchaser the right to use a service (or other content) for a particular term. For example, you would use a service item to sell a user a license for a month of online gameplay.\n Unlike downloadable content, no data needs to be downloaded to the system after the license has been purchased for service items.\n Network connection to an independent server is used to check the license information and provide services based on that license. For this reason, to provide items you must prepare an independent server for each application. In addition, a network connection is required.\n \tA ticket to play an online game for 30 days. \t \tNintendo eShop started from the HOME Menu \tEC applet called from within the application\n Info\n There currently is no feature that follows the conventional style for selling consumable items or any alternative features that would allow you to sell items like jewels that you can exchange for items inside the application. The timing for this release is TBD.\n Contact Nintendo if your game design calls for features like selling consumable items.\nSales Methods\nBoth downloadable content and subscription service items can be purchased from either the shop started from the HOME Menu or the EC applet called from within the application.\nPurchase through the EC applet is provided only by having the process from listing the items through purchasing occur within the EC applet. Currently there is no feature available that allows you to obtain product information from the eShop server from within an application, display an item list, and purchase selected items. The time for this feature being available is TBD.\n Figure 7-1 Sale Flowchart\nPurchase Method\nDownloadable content and service items can be purchased using an account balance or a credit card registered in Nintendo eShop, or by using item vouchers.\n Table 7-2 Methods of Making Purchases\n \tPurchase Method \tDescription\n \tUse Money in Account Balance \t The account balance is the money the user has in their Nintendo Account. This balance is debited when an item is purchased.\n Users can add to their balances using either a credit card or a Nintendo Prepaid Card.\n For instance, purchasing a $10 Nintendo Prepaid Card and entering the card number into Nintendo eShop increases the balance by $10.\n \tPay Directly With Credit Card \t In this method, transactions are settled using the credit card registered in the Nintendo eShop.\n \tUse Item Vouchers \t Item vouchers have specific alphanumeric codes (item voucher codes) that can be entered to redeem the corresponding downloadable content.\n Contact Nintendo if you are considering a design that uses item vouchers.\n As now planned, this exchanging of vouchers for downloadable content will be possible only via the Nintendo eShop system application. No time frame has been set for when the EC applet will incorporate this functionality.\n There is no support for subscription service item vouchers. The timing for this release is TBD.\n Info\n Settlement using e-money on the NX is TBD.\nPromotional Code\nThe promotional code feature displays a special string when the user has purchased an application or DLC on the Nintendo eShop.\nThis feature can be used to distribute codes for using proprietary services.\nSeason Pass\nThe season pass is a way for users to pre-purchase downloadable content that will become available at some later date.\nThere are restrictions on implementing season passes, so contact Nintendo if your game design calls for this feature.\nOwner Discount\nAn owner discount refers to a system that allows a user who has purchased and owns a certain item to purchase other items at a certain discounted price.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]

"\t\t\n8 Development Environment\nThis section introduces the development hardware and software used for NX application development.\nDevelopment Hardware\nThere are two types of development hardware: the SDEV, with its advanced features, and the EDEV, in a format that more closely resembles a production device. As indicated in the following descriptions, their characteristics and features differ, allowing you to choose the equipment that includes the features that most meet your development needs.\nSDEV\nSDEV is a device with advanced features, including many external interfaces that are useful for development but not found in the product. The SDEV motherboard has a built-in, dedicated PCB for adding extra features, making the SDEV larger than the EDEV.\nThe SDEV is equipped with an HDMI output port and a debug controller connection port, and connects to the PC by a wired Ethernet connection. However, it has no built-in battery, so when running it, power must be supplied via an AC adapter.\nFor more information about the SDEV, see the SDEV Operations Manual.\n Figure 8-1 Appearance of the SDEV\nEDEV\nThe EDEV is development hardware that resembles the retail device. EDEV offers fewer debugging features than SDEV, but you can develop an entire application using only EDEV.\nThe EDEV looks like a retail device and has a built-in battery. It allows you to test applications in a cable-free environment.\n For more information about the EDEV, see the EDEV Operations Manual.\n Figure 8-2 Appearance of the EDEV (With JOY-CON Attached)\nNX Development Cards\nNX development cards are NX game cards that can be used on development hardware. The NX development card capacity is 32 GB.\nComparing SDEV and EDEV\nThe main features of SDEV and EDEV are as follows.\n Table 8-1 Comparing SDEV and EDEV Features\nO --- Supported X --- Not Supported\n \t \tSDEV \tEDEV \t(For Reference) NX Full Retail Unit\n \tShape \tThe back is thicker than the back of the retail unit. \tIdentical to the retail unit. \t－\n \tMain memory \t4 GB LPDDR4 \t4 GB LPDDR4 \t4 GB LPDDR4\n \tSystem memory \t64 GB eMMC \t64 GB eMMC \t32 GB eMMC\n \tNX Game Cards \tCan read or write NX development cards. \tCan read or write NX development cards. \tCan read or write retail unit NX game cards.\n \tConnecting to a PC \tEthernet (1 GB) \tUSB 3.0 (Requires a separate external device.) \t×\n \tControl the NX hardware from a PC \t〇 \t× \t×\n \tUses debug controller \t Wii Classic Controller Pro\n Supports retail device\n \t× \t×\n \tHDMI capture of handheld mode (LCD screen) \t〇 \t× \t×\n Software\nSDK\nTo develop NX applications, use NintendoSDK (the standardized development environment for the Nintendo platform) and an expansion module for the NX.\nFor more information, see the NintendoSDK documentation.\nGame Engine\nThis section describes the game engines available on the NX system.\nUnreal Engine 4\nUnreal Engine 4 (UE4) is a game engine developed by Epic Games. It contains all of the features required for game development and provides a toolset that enables high-quality game experiences.\nUE4 contains not only high-level graphics power, but also several features that represent a major evolution for the development environment. These features include Blueprint, a visual scripting system that allows you to create games without using any code; Cascade, which can freely manipulate millions of particles to create realistic flame and smoke; and Content Browser, which provides functional asset management.\nUE4 is also upgraded for free by Epic Games every few months, and they are constantly adding new features, improvements, and bug fixes. The NX version will include these latest revisions, and will be optimized so that you can create games while taking full advantage of the hardware performance. Note that there may be restrictions on available functionality, depending on NX performance.\nYou must obtain a license for UE4 from Epic Games.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]
