The bot is currently running with dlvr.it and zapier.com. I'd like to create my own service/bot for it or ask someone to do it for me (for money) one of these days, so it can look for news more often (check for news every 30seconds instead of 5-30minutes) and from a high number of sources (my current solutions have a limit of feeds).<br>
It should also give me the ability to customize the bot a lot more.<br>	
<br>
<b><u>About <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoNewsBot">@NintendoNewsBot</a>:</u></b><br>
<br>
This bot collects Nintendo related articles from the best English news websites around the world and automatically posts them to Twitter as soon as they're published.<br>
It aims to reach top accuracy (only post content that really is about Nintendo) and fast speed (post as soon as the news hit the web).<br>
<br>
<b>Sites currently supported:</b><br>
YouTube.com/user/Nintendo<br>
MyNintendoNews.com/<br>
Nintendoeverything.com/category/news/<br>
Eurogamer.net/?type=news<br>
WSJ.com/news/technology<br>
IGN.com/articles?tags=news<br>	
<br>
<b>Sites I want to add:</b><br>
Gamasutra<br>
Gameinformer?<br>
Destructoid?<br>
Siliconera?<br>
Kotaku?<br>
A website focused on indie games<br>
NintendoAmerica Twitter (tweets with links)<br>
NintendoEurope Twitter (tweets with links)<br>
<br>
... and more!<br>
<br>		
<b>Removed:</b><br>
http://www.nintendolife.com/ (I removed it cause even without NintendoLife there are already 2 pure Nintendo sites being used. A third posting the same news made it too spammy.)<br>
Forbes.com (They don't post a lot of news, mostly opinions by their contributors.)
		<br>
If you think there should be any sites added or removed from this list, please let me know.
<br><br>
Keywords the bot is looking for on sites that are not purely Nintendo:<br>
Nintendo,NX,Pokemon,Zelda,Smash Bros,3DS,Kirby,Mario,Splatoon,Pikmin,Wii U,WiiU<br>
<br>
It's currently only looking for very few keywords, as it's still being tested. A lot more keywords will be added soon.<br>
<br>
Things I want to add:<br>
- A cooldown for when an article with a certain keyword has been posted recently so the same news doesn't get repeated too many times.<br>
Example: Site A posts new news about NX and many other sites will follow as it became a hot topic. I'd like to prevent that the same news gets posted many times in a row. (Should be able to make exceptions or set a variable cooldown so hot topics get tweeted more often.)<br>
