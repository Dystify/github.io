<b>NOTE: Bot is currently in BETA.</b> Currently testing if filters work properly and checking for what kind of content it will tweet.<br>
<br>
The bot is currently running with dlvr.it and zapier.com. When I have the time I'll work on creating my own service/bot for it, so it can look for news more often (check for news every 30seconds instead of 5-30minutes) and from a high number of sources (my current solutions have a limit of feeds).<br>
It will also give me the ability to customize the bot a lot more.<br>	
<br>
<b><u>About <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoNewsBot">@NintendoNewsBot</a>:</u></b><br>
<br>
This bot collects Nintendo related articles from the best English news websites around the world and automatically posts them to Twitter as soon as they're published.<br>
It aims to reach top accuracy (only post content that really is about Nintendo) and fast speed (post as soon as the news hit the web).<br>
<br>
<b>Sites currently supported:</b><br>
YouTube.com/user/Nintendo<br>
MyNintendoNews.com/<br>
Nintendoeverything.com/category/news/<br>
Eurogamer.net/?type=news<br>
WSJ.com/news/technology<br>
Forbes.com/technology/<br>
IGN.com/articles?tags=news<br>
NvidiaNews.Nvidia.com (lol)<br>		
<br>
<b>Sites I want to add:</b><br>
Gamasutra<br>
Gameinformer?<br>
Destructoid?<br>
Siliconera?<br>
Kotaku?<br>
A website focused on indie games<br>
NintendoAmerica Twitter (tweets with links)<br>
NintendoEurope Twitter (tweets with links)<br>
<br>
... and more!<br>
<br>		
<b>Removed:</b><br>
http://www.nintendolife.com/ (I removed it cause even without NintendoLife there are already 2 pure Nintendo sites being used. A third posting the same news made it too spammy.)<br>
<br>
If you think there should be any sites added or removed from this list, please let me know.
<br><br>
Keywords the bot is looking for on sites that are not purely Nintendo:<br>
Nintendo,NX,Pokemon,Zelda,Smash Bros,3DS,Kirby,Mario,Splatoon,Pikmin,Wii U,WiiU<br>
<br>
It's currently only looking for very few keywords, as it's still being tested. A lot more keywords will be added soon.<br>
<br>
Things I want to add:<br>
- A cooldown for when an article with a certain keyword has been posted recently so the same news doesn't get repeated too many times.<br>
Example: Site A posts new news about NX and many other sites will follow as it became a hot topic. I'd like to prevent that the same news gets posted many times in a row. (Should be able to make exceptions or set a variable cooldown so hot topics get tweeted more often.)<br>
