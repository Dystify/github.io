<!-- 4.4 Friends -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_105383736">4.4 Friends</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>With the NX, you can become friends with other users, check on their online status, and join together online to play games.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_105383736_h1_1">Features</h1>
<p>The Friends mechanism on the NX has the following characteristics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friends are saved independently for each user.</li>
  <li>Each user can have as many as 300 friends.</li>
  <li>To use the Friends feature, the user must be linked to a Nintendo Account.</li>
  <li>There is a Favorites feature, and friends set to Favorites are displayed preferentially in the friend list. For more information about the friend list, see <a href="../Pages/Page_91219211.html" target="">5.2.1 My Page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_105383736_h2_1">Scope of Usage</h2>
<p>NX friends are friends only within the scope of the NX platform and in principle only can be used in NX applications. They are not friends who are shared with non-NX applications that use Nintendo Accounts.</p>
<p>If you want, you can choose not to use the NX Friends feature, and instead make and use an application-specific friendship mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_105383736_h2_2">Becoming Friends</h2>
<p>The following methods for becoming friends are planned. The details are under evaluation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friend request using a friend code<br />Make the friend request using the code issued to each user.</li>
  <li>Friend request from Player History<br />Make the friend request from the Player History in the application.</li>
  <li>Friend request from inside the application<br />Send a friend request from inside the application (providing that the application supports calls to the system feature for making friend requests).</li>
  <li>Schedule friend request using local communication<br />Use local communication and schedule friend requests to be sent to the users of nearby NX systems. Friendships cannot be established this way when NX systems are offline.  The friendships are officially established the next time the NX systems connect to the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also plans to provide a feature to recommend users as candidate friends when they play on the NX if those users are already your friends in non-NX applications.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_105383736_h2_3">Friend Presence </h2>
<p>Friend Presence is a feature that uses the Internet to convey information in real time about the online status of friends and the applications they are playing. Among possibilities, we see this being used in the application to check whether friends are in the joinable state, and to use the Friend List system feature screen to show what applications friends are playing.</p>
