"\t\t\n4.3 Software Keyboard Applet\nThis applet is invoked by the application to allow users to enter their names, passwords, and other text when text input is required.\nYou can set parameters to, for example, enable and disable predictive text input or block the input of specific characters.\n Note that the application must allocate the working memory, on the order of a few kilobytes, for this applet.\n Note\n The NX does not support input methods like handheld input and hand-drawn input that were supported on devices such as the Wii U.\nBasic Configuration\nThe screen is split into upper and lower halves. The upper half is a preview field where you preview the entered text. The lower half contains a keyboard that can be used for text entry, and a footer that displays a description of actions. The screen of the application that called the software keyboard applet appears in the background of the upper half.\n Figure 4-1 Configuration Elements of the Software Keyboard\n Table 4-1 Description of the Configuration Elements of the Software Keyboard\n \tNumber \tName \tDescription\n \t 1 \tPreview Field \tShows the text that the player entered.\n \t 2 \tKeyboard \t Appears as a layout of buttons that enable text entry.\n When predictive text input is enabled, a field will appear above the keyboard for displaying conversion candidates.\n \t 3 \tFooter \tDisplays a guide for using controller buttons.\n Launch Parameters\nYou can easily customize the software keyboard by setting startup parameters.\nYou can configure the following parameters.\n \tKeyboard type\n \tWhether to enable or disable predictive text input\n \tProhibited characters\n \tWhether to enable or disable the hide input text feature\n \tWhether to allow or prohibit new lines\n \tThe maximum or minimum number of characters\nKeyboard Type\nThere are three types, or modes, of keyboards, classified by the types of characters that can be entered. The full mode is the default.\n Table 4-2 Keyboard Types\n \tName \tDescription\n \tFull Mode \t Not only can you enter commonly used alphanumeric characters, you can also enter a wide variety of symbols, kanji, and kana.\n The characters that can be entered are not dependent on the region and language settings because the player can change keyboard layouts as desired.However, the keyboard layout that will appear first depends on those region and language settings.\n \tASCII Mode \tOnly ASCII characters can be entered.\n \tNumeric Mode \tOnly numbers can be entered. Parameters can be set, however, to enable input of two additional characters.\n Enabling and Disabling Predictive Text Input\nPredictive text input can be enabled and disabled.\nUser Dictionaries\nYou can add user dictionaries, which are dictionaries created in the application, to the dictionary used for predictive text input.\nYou can also configure the software keyboard to not use dictionaries it normally would, and to use only user dictionaries instead.\nLearning\nPredictive text input learning occurs automatically by using the software keyboard. Applications cannot enable or disable this learning.\nLearning data is saved for each user account. That data will continue to be available whenever the software keyboard is subsequently called.\nCustomers can delete learning data in the System Settings.\n Note\n The ability to continue using learning data is only available when just one user is selected. Learning data is not used from one session to the next when no users are selected or when multiple users are selected.\nSetting Prohibited Characters\nYou can use settings to block the input of the following types of characters.\n \tNumbers\n \t%\n \t/ (slash)\n \t\\ (backslash)\n \t@\n \tSpaces\n \tAll characters except those used for download codes\n \tAll characters except those used for Mii nicknames\nAll characters except those used for download codes\nAny characters other than the following are blocked. You cannot enter a capital O, I, or Z.\n \t0123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXY\nAll characters except those used for Mii nicknames\nCharacters that are not included in Appendix: Characters That Can Be Used in the User Account Nickname in the Account Guide are blocked. For more information, see the Account Guide.\nEnabling and Disabling the Hide Input Text Feature\nYou can use settings to enable or disable the ability to immediately hide player input.\nWe expect this feature to be enabled at times such as when entering passwords.\nAllowing or Prohibiting New Lines\nYou can set whether players can include new lines within entered text.\nSetting the Maximum or Minimum Number of Characters\nYou can use settings to configure the maximum number of characters that can be entered, and the minimum number of characters required for valid input.\nWorking With Hardware Keyboards\nNintendo also plans to support input from USB hardware keyboards.\nText That Can Be Entered Using a Software Keyboard\nThe text that can be entered varies based on keyboard type and whether predictive text input is enabled or disabled.\nNote that all characters included among the NX system fonts, excluding Nintendo extended characters, can be entered when predictive text input is enabled.\nThe following list includes the available characters. That list is included with this package.\n Table 4-3 Available Characters\n \tCondition \tFilename\n \tWhen Predictive Text Input Is Enabled \t NX_SWKBD_CodeList_Predictive_Func_Enable.xlsx\n \t When Predictive Text Input Is Disabled and the Keyboard Type Is Full Mode\n \t NX_SWKBD_CodeList_Full.xlsx\n \tWhen Predictive Text Input Is Disabled and the Keyboard Type Is ASCII Mode \t NX_SWKBD_CodeList_ASCII.xlsx\n Note\n The characters that can be entered are not dependent on the settings for region and language within the system settings.\n It is possible to enter both kanji and Cyrillic text, for example, even when using the full mode keyboard type, and when the language is set to English in the System Settings.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]

applied at the NX level, and not at the account level.\n Table 3-4 Parental Controls\n \tItem \tDescription \tNotes\n \tPlay time \t By associating the provisionally named NX Monitoring smart device app with an NX, you can set NX play time from that app. You can configure how much play time is available per day, or until what time of the day that play time is available.\n The amount of remaining play time will appear on the NX, but settings cannot be changed there.\n A notification appears on the NX when the configured time is reached. Notifications also occur at the following points: 30 minutes prior, 5 minutes prior, 5 minutes after, 30 minutes after, and then at each thirty-minute mark until two hours have passed.\n Use the forced break mode to interrupt the application at the configured time, and to end the ability to play that application on that day. After you enter that mode, there are two options for the player: either enter sleep mode or have a parent or guardian enter the PIN for this restriction to reopen that application.\n \t This option can only be configured within the provisionally named NX Monitoring smart device app. Settings cannot be made on the NX.\n The provisionally named NX Monitoring app is for use with smartphones. For more information about that app, see 5.5. Setting and Checking From Smart Device Apps, in the Overview.\n Game behavior during forced break mode:\n The application will enter the same state as when the HOME Button has been pressed. There are no additional items, because forced break mode is in use.\n \tSoftware restrictions \tThis option restricts starting software based on target ages. \t\n \tPosting screenshots to social media \tThis option restricts functionality to post captured screenshots to social media. \t\n \tCommunicate freely with anyone \tThis option restricts functionality where you exchange text or drawings with other people over the Internet. \t\n Theme\nYou can change the screen background and text color for the following features.\n \tSystem Menus, including the Entrance, HOME Menu, and Launcher\n \tSystem Applications\n \tLibrary Applets\nBlack and white color types are available. White is the default. More color types may be added in the future.\nSetting Color Types From the Application\nYou can change the color type to suit the design or world view of an application. This can only occur for library applets called from the application. An API for setting color types is scheduled to be provided.\nAny of the following values can be specified using that API.\n \tThe use of a color type specified by the application, although this is limited to the color types available in system settings.\n \tThe continued use of a color type configured by the player.\n Note\n The applet will appear, using the color type that the player configured, when a library applet is called without specifying a color type. Color types other than black and white might be added in the future.\n Note\n The following library applets do not support the specification of a color type. They are always displayed using the same color, regardless of the theme set by the user.\n \tCreate or Edit Mii Applet\n \tWeb Applet\n \tOffline Web Applet\n \tEC applet\nDate and Time\nAlthough you can set date and time manually, by default that information is obtained from network clocks. There are also time zone settings and support for daylight saving time.\nFor more detailed specifications, see the TIME library manual in the NintendoSDK documentation.\nAuto-Sleep\nThe time until auto-sleep in user settings differs between handheld mode and TV mode.\nAlso, the time when the screen goes dark prior to auto-sleep is different based on the set time. The details are as follows.\n Table 3-5 Time Until Auto-Sleep\n \tMode \tTime Until Auto-Sleep \tTime Until Screen Goes Dark\n \tHandheld mode \t 1 minutes\n \t15 seconds beforehand\n \t3 minutes \tAfter 2 minutes have passed\n \t5 minutes \tAfter 4 minutes have passed\n \t10 minutes \tAfter 5 minutes have passed\n \t30 minutes \tAfter 5 minutes have passed\n \tNo \tAfter 5 minutes have passed\n \tTV mode \t 1 hour\n \tIf screen burn-in reduction is enabled,\nthe screen goes dark after five minutes have passed in all cases.\n \t2 hours\n \t3 hours\n \t6 hours\n \t12 hours\n \tNo\n Deleting All Content and Settings\nTBD\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]
