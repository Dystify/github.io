<p>The screen is split into upper and lower halves. The upper half is a <em>preview field</em> where you preview the entered text. The lower half contains a <em>keyboard</em> that can be used for text entry, and a <em>footer</em> that displays a description of actions. The screen of the application that called the software keyboard applet appears in the background of the upper half.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_172887793_h1_2">Launch Parameters</h1>
<p>You can easily customize the software keyboard by setting startup parameters.</p>
<p>You can configure the following parameters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keyboard type</li>
  <li>Whether to enable or disable predictive text input</li>
  <li>Prohibited characters</li>
  <li>Whether to enable or disable the hide input text feature</li>
  <li>Whether to allow or prohibit new lines<br /></li>
  <li>The maximum or minimum number of characters</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_172887793_h2_1">Keyboard Type</h2>
<p>There are three types, or <em>modes</em>, of keyboards, classified by the types of characters that can be entered. The full mode is the default.</p>

        <p>Not only can you enter commonly used alphanumeric characters, you can also enter a wide variety of symbols, kanji, and kana.</p>
        <p>The characters that can be entered are not dependent on the region and language settings because the player can change keyboard layouts as desired.However, the keyboard layout that will appear first depends on those region and language settings.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_172887793_h2_2">Enabling and Disabling Predictive Text Input</h2>
<p>Predictive text input can be enabled and disabled.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_172887793_h3_1">User Dictionaries</h3>
<p>You can add user dictionaries, which are dictionaries created in the application, to the dictionary used for predictive text input.</p>
<p>You can also configure the software keyboard to not use dictionaries it normally would, and to use only user dictionaries instead.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_172887793_h3_2">Learning</h3>
<p>Predictive text input learning occurs automatically by using the software keyboard. Applications cannot enable or disable this learning.</p>
<p>Learning data is saved for each user account. That data will continue to be available whenever the software keyboard is subsequently called.</p>
<p>Customers can delete learning data in the System Settings.</p>
<p />
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p xmlns="">The ability to continue using learning data is only available when just one user is selected. Learning data is not used from one session to the next when no users are selected or when multiple users are selected.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_172887793_h2_3">Setting Prohibited Characters</h2>

<h2 id="Anchor_172887793_h2_4">Enabling and Disabling the Hide Input Text Feature</h2>
<p>You can use settings to enable or disable the ability to immediately hide player input.</p>
