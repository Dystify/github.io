<p>The NX dock is a bundled device that is used to have the NX operate as a console gaming device.</p>
<p>In addition to offering HDMI output to a TV (for video and audio), it also recharges the NX.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_95689337_h2_2">Differences in Behavior When Removed From the NX Dock</h2>
<p>Due to heat generated when the device is held in the hands, NX-SoC performance will be different when the system is docked in the NX dock and when it is removed. Details are under evaluation.</p>
<p>The following features are enabled when the NX is removed from the NX dock.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speakers</li>
  <li>Built-in accelerometer and motion sensor</li>
  <li>Built-in LCD screen and touch screen</li>
</ul>

  <h1 xmlns="" id="Anchor_95689337_h1_2">Classic-Grip Accessory</h1>
  <div class="figure">
    <a name="AutoAnchor_95689337_figure002"></a>Figure 3-6  Appearance of the Accessory-Grip Accessory (at left: before attaching the JOY-CON; at right: after attaching the JOY-CON)</div>
  <p xmlns="">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_95689337/96638490.png" width="800" />
  </p>
  <p xmlns="">The left and right JOY-CON controllers snap in to the classic-grip accessory to enable players to securely handle them as one controller in both hands. The classic-grip accessory is bundled with the system. This is not the electronic specification.</p>
  <p xmlns="">In addition, there is also a classic-grip accessory with charging function that includes a charging function, but it is not included with the system. The classic-grip accessory with charging function has a USB connector (Type-C shape), and a USB cable can be connected to charge the JOY-CON controllers.</p>
  <h1 xmlns="" id="Anchor_95689337_h1_3">JOY-CON Strap</h1>

    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_95689337/161425346.png" width="400" />
  </p>
  <p xmlns="">The JOY-CON strap can be attached to the rail on the side of the JOY-CON.</p>
  <p xmlns="">This strap makes it easier to hold the JOY-CON and makes it safer when the controller is being waved around. It also makes it easier to press SL and SR when the JOY-CON is held horizontally.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_95689337_h1_4">AC Adapter</h1>
<p>An adapter, bundled with the system, that provides the NX console and NX dock with power.</p>
<p>The console and NX dock use a USB connector (Type-C shape).</p>

<div class="selectable_private">
  <p xmlns="">The NX Pro Controller is a wireless controller with the same number of buttons as the controller part of the NX system in handheld style. Its design focuses more on being easy to hold and operate than the JOY-CON, and is intended to be used when a single player wants to take their time playing through the game. It is not included with the system.</p>
  <p xmlns="">This controller may be connected with the NX system by a wireless connection and used instead of the JOY-CON. However, the supported device features and the number of features may differ from the JOY-CON. For more information, see <a href="#AutoAnchor_95689337_table002" target="">Table 3-5  Comparison of Full Key Controller and the Devices Provided by the JOY-CON</a>. Although the JOY-CON has independent directional input buttons for up, down, left, and right, the NX Pro Controller has a +Control Pad. It is possible to simultaneously input left + right or up + down on the JOY-CON, but not on the NX Pro Controller. Be careful of this difference when implementing applications.</p>
  <p xmlns="">Up to eight controllers can be connected to one NX system at the same time, including JOY-CON controllers.</p>
